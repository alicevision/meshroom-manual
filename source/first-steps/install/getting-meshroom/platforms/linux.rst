1. Extract the .tar.gz file in any folder.

.. code-block:: bash

  tar -xf Meshroom-20XX.Y.Z-linux-cudaCC.tar.gz

  cd Meshroom-20XX.Y.Z

2. From this folder run:

.. code-block:: bash

  ./Meshroom

to launch the GUI.

See the `AUR page <https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/meshroom-bin/>`_ for more information.

Set up environment
++++++++++++++++++

Meshroom requires a build of AliceVision and need to have `AliceVision <https://github.com/alicevision/AliceVision>`_ installation in your ``PATH`` and ``LD_LIBRARY_PATH``.

Your ``PATH`` should contain the folder where the AliveVision binaries can be found.
Suppose ALICEVISION_INSTALL contains the directory where the library is installed, then

.. code-block:: bash

  PATH=$PATH:${ALICEVISION_INSTALL}/bin


.. note::
  On some distributions (e.g Ubuntu), you may have conflicts between native drivers and mesa drivers, resulting in an empty black window. In that case, you need to force usage of native drivers by adding them to the ``LD_LIBRARY_PATH``:

  .. code-block:: bash

    LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib/nvidia-340:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH

  You may need to adjust the folder ``/usr/lib/nvidia-340`` with the correct driver version (e.g. ``330``, ``350`` etc..).

We suggest to create a bash executable ``meshroom.sh`` in the root of the meshroom folder to ease the task:

.. code-block:: bash

  #!/bin/bash

  # this should point to the installation folder of AliceVision, for the pre-built binaries
  # it would be the full path to the folder aliceVision
  export ALICEVISION_INSTALL=/path/to/aliceVision

  # if you are using the plugins, here list all the paths to find them
  #f or the pre-built binaries it is the full path to the folder qtPlugins/qml/
  export QML2_IMPORT_PATH=/path/to/qmlAlembic/build/install/qml:/path/to/QtAliceVision/build/install/qml:/path/to/QtOIIO/build/install/qml/:$QML2_IMPORT_PATH

  # location of the sensor database
  export ALICEVISION_SENSOR_DB=${ALICEVISION_INSTALL}/share/aliceVision/cameraSensors.db

  # adjust according to your driver and cuda version
  export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${ALICEVISION_INSTALL}/lib:/usr/lib/nvidia-384:/usr/local/cuda-8.0/lib64/:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH

  # the meshroom path (the current directory)
  export MESHROOMPATH=$PWD

  # this line launch whatever script and relevant options that are given as input ($@)
  PYTHONPATH=${MESHROOMPATH} PATH=$PATH:${ALICEVISION_INSTALL}/bin python ${MESHROOMPATH}/$@

Then you can also create an executable ``meshroom_ui.sh`` to launch the GUI:

.. code-block:: bash

  #!/bin/bash
  ./meshroom.sh meshroom/ui $@

Don't forget to make the two files executable:

.. code-block:: bash

  chmod +x meshroom.sh meshroom_ui.sh


Launch the User Interface
+++++++++++++++++++++++++

To launch the user interface simply use the previous shell script:

.. code-block:: bash

  # launch the gui
  ./meshroom_ui

  # launch the gui with e.g. a given Project
  ./meshroom_ui --project myProject.mg

  # launch with --help for the list of supported parameters
  ./meshroom_ui --help
